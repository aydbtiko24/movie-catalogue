Movie Catalogue is a project "base on" my last submission at [Dicoding Belajar Android Jetpack Pro](https://www.dicoding.com/academies/129) which currently has 3 main screens to display A list of Movies, Tv-Shows, and Favourite.

Uses [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) to load Movies And Tv Shows data, if you willing to clone this repo don't forget to 
[get the Api Key from TMDB](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction), once you get the key copy the default API value from 
[api.properties](main/api.properties) replace the empty string with your API key and add into your locale.properties file.

## Architecture

* [Presentation](main/app): A layer that interacts with the UI, mainly Android Stuff like Activities, Fragments, ViewModel, etc. It would include both domain and data layers.

* [Domain](main/domain): Contains the business logic of the application. It is the individual and innermost module. It‚Äôs a complete kotlin module.

* [Data](main/data): It includes the domain layer. It would implement the interface exposed by domain layer and dispenses data to app.

To allow the business to adapt to changing technology and interfaces. While the internet might move from desktop to mobile, or from mobile to virtual assistant, the core business remains the same. I decided to rewrite Movie Catalogue with [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html).
